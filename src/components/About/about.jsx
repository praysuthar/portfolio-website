				Hi, Iâ€™m a recent graduate with a passion for web development. I have
				experience in building full-stack web applications using the MERN stack
				(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I enjoy creating responsive and
				user-friendly front-end interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
				also have skills in back-end development, RESTful APIs, and database
				management. Iâ€™m a team player who values collaboration, communication,
				and feedback. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my
				coding skills. Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to work on exciting and
				challenging projects that can make a positive impact. You can check out
				some of my work on my GitHub profile or contact me via email. Thank you
				for visiting my website! ðŸ˜Š
